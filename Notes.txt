Step 1: Learn HTML and CSS
Before you dive into JavaScript, you should first learn HTML and CSS, which are the building blocks of web development. HTML is used to create the structure of a web page, while CSS is used to style the page and make it look good. You can learn HTML and CSS from resources like W3Schools, MDN Web Docs, and Codecademy.

Step 2: Learn JavaScript basics
Once you're comfortable with HTML and CSS, you can start learning JavaScript basics. This includes understanding variables, data types, functions, and control structures like loops and conditionals. You can learn JavaScript basics from resources like Codecademy, MDN Web Docs, and Eloquent JavaScript.

Step 3: Choose a JavaScript framework or library
There are many popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular options include:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Angular: A full-featured JavaScript framework for building complex web applications
Vue.js: A lightweight JavaScript framework for building reactive user interfaces
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser
Research each option and consider your specific needs and preferences to decide which one to learn. If you're interested in building user interfaces, React is a good place to start. If you want to build complex web applications, Angular may be a better fit. If you want a lightweight framework, Vue.js is a good option. If you're interested in server-side development, Node.js is a good choice.

Step 4: Practice, practice, practice
No matter which framework or library you choose, the key to mastering web development is practice. Build small projects and gradually work your way up to more complex ones. Participate in online communities like Stack Overflow and GitHub to get help and feedback from other developers. And most importantly, don't be afraid to make mistakes - they're an essential part of the learning process.

Step 5: Keep learning
Web development is a constantly evolving field, so it's important to stay up-to-date on the latest technologies and best practices. Attend conferences and meetups, read blogs and books, and keep practicing to keep your skills sharp.

Remember that everyone's learning journey is different, so don't get discouraged if you encounter roadblocks along the way. Keep practicing, stay curious, and have fun!
